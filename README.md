# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition is a machine learning project that identifies digits (0â€“9) from images, typically using neural networks. It takes an image of a handwritten digit as input and predicts the correct number with high accuracy, often trained on the MNIST dataset.
